# Async location streamer using new concurrency

### Please star the repository if you believe continuing the development of this package is worthwhile. This will help me understand which package deserves more effort.

This package uses Core Location under the hood to harness the power of GPS for accurate and efficient location tracking. By leveraging Swift’s async/await concurrency model, it provides a modern, clean, and scalable way to stream GPS data asynchronously. Core Location works with GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks to determine a device’s position, ensuring both high accuracy and optimal performance.

 ## Features
- [x] Using new concurrency swift model around CoreLocation manager
- [x] Extend API to allow customization of `CLLocationManager`
- [x] Support for iOS from 14.1 and watchOS from 7.0
- [x] Seamless SwiftUI Integration Uses `@Published` properties for real-time UI updates or @observable is you can afford iOS17 or newer.
- [x] Streaming current location asynchronously
- [x] Different strategies - Keep and publish all stack of locations since streaming has started or the last one
- [x] Errors handling (as **AsyncLocationErrors** so CoreLocation errors **CLError**)


## How to use
 
### 1. Add to info the option "Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description" 
 ![Add to info](https://github.com/swiftuiux/swift-async-corelocation-streamer/blob/main/img/image2.png)
 
 **Background Updates**
   - Ensure the app has `location` included in `UIBackgroundModes` for background updates to function.
 
### 2. Add or inject LocationStreamer into a View

```
    @StateObject var service: LocationStreamer 
```
For iOS 17+ and watchOS 10+, using @State macro:
```
    @State var service: ObservableLocationStreamer
```

### 3. Call LocationStreamer method start() within async environment or check SwiftUI example
```
    try await service.start()
```

### LocationStreamer parameters

|Param|Description|
| --- | --- |
|strategy| Strategy for publishing locations. Default value is **KeepLastStrategy**. Another predefined option is **KeepAllStrategy**, or you can implement and test your own custom strategy by conforming to the `LocationResultStrategy` protocol. |
|accuracy| The accuracy of a geographical coordinate.|
|activityType| Constants indicating the type of activity associated with location updates.|
|distanceFilter| A distance in meters from an existing location to trigger updates.|
|backgroundUpdates| A Boolean value that indicates whether the app receives location updates when running in the background. |
